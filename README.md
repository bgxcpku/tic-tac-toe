# tic-tac-toe
This is the project for Flatiron School

A few things need to work on to build the tic-tac-toe:

1, A 3x3 board, we could simplify it by using
board = 
[[nil, nil, nil],
[nil, nil, nil],
[nil, nil, nil]]

2, Get input from human player
move = get.chomp

3, Best strategy of the program
After human makes a move, program should
(1), define the available_moves
(2), check if program has two in a row, column, or X, if third belong to available_moves, place it to win
(3), check if human has two in a row, column, or X, if so stop him



(1) Ask Human Player Name: (Steve)
(2) Welcome Steve
(3) Print out the Board
(4) Ask Steve for first move
(5) Check if Steve wins, Check if Board if full
(6) Potato (computer)'s move
(7) Check if Potato wins, Check if Board if full
(8) Repeat (4) - (8) until someone wins or the Board is full
(9) Display results
(10) Play again ? Yes/No
